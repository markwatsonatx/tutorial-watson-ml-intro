### Intro. to Apache Spark and Scala Notebooks

This project shows you how to use Scala Notebooks and Apache Spark to perform simple analysis on the Back to the Future transcript.

Follow these simple instructions and you'll be up and running:

```
git clone https://github.com/markwatsonatx/tutorial-spark-notebook-wordcount-scala
cd tutorial-spark-notebook-wordcount-scala
docker-compose up -d
```

After running `docker-compose up -d` you can access the sample notebook at [http://DOCKER-HOST-IP:38889/notebooks/WordCountScala.ipynb](http://localhost:38889/notebooks/WordCountScala.ipynb).

You can learn more by watching the YouTube video [here](https://youtu.be/zy9JB7sxjGs).
Note: the YouTube video walks through the Python version of the notebook which is also avaiable in this project at [http://DOCKER-HOST-IP:38889/notebooks/WordCountPython.ipynb](http://localhost:38889/notebooks/WordCountPython.ipynb).
